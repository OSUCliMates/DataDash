# DataDash
repository for EDA shiny related files

# Git setup/workflow
See [https://github.com/OSUCliMates/CliMates/blob/master/workflow.md](Charlotte's github workflow document) in our other repo to setup git remote, and to see workflow details

# Architecture
currently, within the dataDash directory we've got

* .gitignore
* app.R (the R script for the app itself)
* setup.R (an R script to run before anything in the app happens to do stuff like name filepath variables, load packages, etc.)
* README.md (you're reading this now)
